# As a forward to the madness below, we are doing something incredibly sneeky.
# We have BaseVector, which we want to have all of the shared functionality
# of all Vector subclasses. We also want each Vector class to be a NamedTuple
# so we can let Python handle storing data in the most efficiant way and
# make Vectors immutable.
#
# Problem is, we can't have Vector classes be
# subclasses of both NamedTuple and BaseVector, because mypy says
# `NamedTuple should be a single base  [misc]`, and at runtime the typing module
# stops us with `TypeError: can only inherit from a NamedTuple type and Generic`
# So the question becomes, how does NamedTuple work anyways? Can we
# duplicate its functionality? Turns out it's not as simple as it seems.
# NamedTuples are not actually real classes. They are fake classes that under
# the hood use a metaclass called NamedTupleMeta to create the real namedtuple
# from collections.abc.
#
# So my solution was to override NamedTupleMeta with my own version
# without the runtime check, and that works great. Problem is, type checkers
# don't think you are allowed to subclass more than NamedTuple and Generic,
# so we have do do a bit of a hack to avoid that as well.
